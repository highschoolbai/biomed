  <h2>The Bioethics of CRISPR: Defending Bacteria to Engineering Babies?</h2>
  <p> By Kevin Bai - Sept 12, 2020
</p>
<p>In certain prokaryotic organisms, special DNA sequences called the CRISPR-Cas system act as a basic immune system to defend against infection. The first major property of this system, CRISPR, is a DNA array that stores known bacteriophage DNA. CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, which describe the repetitive nucleotide sequences and alternating Bacteriophage DNA fragments (spacers) that make up the system. Secondly, Cas genes produce enzymes that access and store simpler versions of these spacers known as crRNA. The proteins then actively seek and destroy pathogenic DNA that contains matching DNA bases. Francis Mojica and his team is most frequently attributed to the discovery and naming of CRISPR in 1987.
<br/><br/>
Since 1987, research regarding the CRISPR-Cas system has now innovated the process of gene editing. With a reliable method to accurately cut unwanted DNA away and microinject desirable genes, scientists are on the verge of creating miracles. Genetic diseases could be forgotten as mutated genes are simply cut away and replaced with artificial DNA. However, these solutions also introduce a plethora of ethical issues.
<br/><br/>
If you’ve ever read/watched Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World Andrew Niccol’s Gattaca, you may be familiar with some gene editing’s ethical issues, especially when the targets are germline cells. Editing egg or sperm cells allows traits to be passed through generations, unlike editing somatic cells which leave reproductive cells unchanged. Introducing desirable traits into newer generations will guarantee descrimination and a bias against the ‘unedited.’ Currently, embryo genome editing is illegal in a multitude of countries, but it is difficult to say when these nations will take back their words in pursuit of power or a competitive edge.

<h2>Why Is There No Cure For Alzheimer’s And Other Dementias?</h2>
 <p>By Kevin Bai - Sept 17, 2020</p>
 <p>Dementia is a classification of neurological symptoms such as memory loss, psychosis, and anxiety that occur together, often the result of an underlying condition. The diseases most commonly associated with dementia - Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s - kill hundreds of thousands per year. Discovered a century ago, why haven’t we found a cure for these fatal conditions?
<br><br>
For this report, we will be primarily focusing on Alzheimer’s disease, the most fatal of the previously listed. First observed in 1906 by Alois Alzhiemer, he described it as a “peculiar severe disease process of the cerebral cortex. Current Alzheimer’s Disease research associates disease emergence with genetic, environmental, and age factors, but no specific causes have been found. The disease is characterized by the overproduction and tangling of Amyloid-Beta and Tau proteins, which block nutrient and nerve impulse flow to neurons, which quickly leads to cell death. MRIs of severe Alzheimer’s patients show a significant loss of brain matter.
<br><br>
There are many possible reasons neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s have no cure. Even though there are millions of medical professionals and hundreds of nonprofit organizations dedicated to the research of Alzheimer’s, that research has only gained traction in the last couple decades. The simplest reason is that we just don’t know what causes it. The brain is an exceptionally complex organ, and identifying a genetic/environmental cause is difficult with the level of technology that is currently available. Although we can detect neurofibrillary tangles through PET scans, their existence is a symptom, not a cause. Another explanation for the lack of research throughout the 1900s is disease pathogenesis. With most Alzheimer’s patients experiencing symptoms in their late 60s, it is possible that life expectancy at the time was not developed enough to observe late stage symptoms. In conclusion, the lack of information regarding Alzheimer’s origins and insignificance during its discovery led to a period of research stagnation.

<h2>Why Is The Coronavirus So Hard To Cure?</h2>
<p>By Kevin Bai - Sept 28th, 2020</p>
The Covid-19 Pandemic is arguably the defining event of 2020. With over 1 million deaths worldwide of the total 35 million cases, the disease has put tremendous strain on countries’ health care systems. Amidst the chaos, numerous pharmaceutical companies have attempted to create a vaccine, but none have produced considerable results. This raises the question of why the Coronavirus - and other viral infections - are so hard to cure.
<br><br>
Covid-19 is classified as a coronavirus, a family of RNA viruses with distinct crown-like spikes on their surface (not named after the beer company). These spikes are glycoproteins that allow the virus to bind and infect host lung cells, which is why coronaviruses are mainly respiratory diseases. Your lung cells have a plethora of different receptor proteins outside their cell membrane, allowing vital molecules to enter. Coronaviruses exploit this function in order to sneak inside the cell, where they subsequently disintegrate and release their viral RNA. In fact, this RNA strand is the main reason viral infections are so hard to cure.
<br><br>
RNA replication is much more susceptible to mutation than regular DNA because of its comparatively unstable structure. However, the frequent breaking of RNA is actually a benefit to viruses, as every mutation changes their molecular structure enough to render antibodies and vaccines useless. Trying to keep up with these viral mutations is extremely difficult because of mutation speed and randomness, but scientists are making progress.
<br><br>
There are a plethora of trial vaccines being produced to combat Covid-19. The 2 most promising vaccines being developed are mRNA and rVSV vaccines. mRNA vaccines introduce a synthetic mRNA into your body in order to stimulate antibody production, which will produce antibodies to combat Covid-19 without the risk of being infected. The latter uses a modified vesicular stomatitis virus to deliver genuine Covid-19 RNA into cells (this method has proven useful in combating diseases such as Ebola).
<br><br>
However, each of these options have drawbacks. mRNA vaccines tend to require multiple doses to achieve a significant immune response, whereas rVSV vaccines may lead to an actual infection. No matter whichever vaccine is finalized first, we must remember that the vaccine will not make Covid-19 disappear. For the considerable future, we all need to follow state safety guidelines in order to protect those more vulnerable.
