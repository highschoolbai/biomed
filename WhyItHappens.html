<h4>In order to develop my interest in biology and other life sciences, I created a website to archive my thoughts and exploration of various topics (usually inspired by online college lectures). Although I enjoy expanding my interests and bolstering my understanding of subjects related to my career interest, I also wanted to educate others on sophisticated topics. I realized many websites such as Wikipedia or National Institutes of Health provide extremely complex explanations that confuse and discourage scholars from developing their interests. In short, that level of research is out of my (and many others’) league. Writing articles that provide in-depth information in a comprehensible manner is where I hope my website can shine, allowing any reader to enjoy learning about the intricacies of our world.<br><br>
I now want to inquire whether those with similar interests as me would like to write an article of their own. If you would like to write an article, or just ask me some questions, please contact me at kbai2002@outlook.com. Even if your interests may not lie in life sciences, don’t be afraid to explore/innovate, I want to create an enjoyable experience for everyone.<br><br>

  <h2>The Bioethics of CRISPR: Defending Bacteria to Engineering Babies?</h2>
  <p> By Kevin Bai - Sept 12, 2020
</p>
<img src = "CRISPR.png" width = 550 height = 500>
<p style="font-size: 16px">In certain prokaryotic organisms, special DNA sequences called the CRISPR-Cas system act as a basic immune system to defend against infection. The first major property of this system, CRISPR, is a DNA array that stores known bacteriophage DNA. CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, which describe the repetitive nucleotide sequences and alternating Bacteriophage DNA fragments (spacers) that make up the system. Secondly, Cas genes produce enzymes that access and store simpler versions of these spacers known as crRNA. The proteins then actively seek and destroy pathogenic DNA that contains matching DNA bases. Francis Mojica and his team is most frequently attributed to the discovery and naming of CRISPR in 1987.
<br/><br/>
Since 1987, research regarding the CRISPR-Cas system has now innovated the process of gene editing. With a reliable method to accurately cut unwanted DNA away and microinject desirable genes, scientists are on the verge of creating miracles. Genetic diseases could be forgotten as mutated genes are simply cut away and replaced with artificial DNA. However, these solutions also introduce a plethora of ethical issues.
<br/><br/>
If you’ve ever read/watched Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World Andrew Niccol’s Gattaca, you may be familiar with some gene editing’s ethical issues, especially when the targets are germline cells. Editing egg or sperm cells allows traits to be passed through generations, unlike editing somatic cells which leave reproductive cells unchanged. Introducing desirable traits into newer generations will guarantee descrimination and a bias against the ‘unedited.’ Currently, embryo genome editing is illegal in a multitude of countries, but it is difficult to say when these nations will take back their words in pursuit of power or a competitive edge.

<h2>Why Is There No Cure For Alzheimer’s And Other Dementias?</h2>
 <p>By Kevin Bai - Sept 17, 2020</p>
 <img src = "r7_brainatrophyalz.jpg">
 <p style="font-size: 16px">Dementia is a classification of neurological symptoms such as memory loss, psychosis, and anxiety that occur together, often the result of an underlying condition. The diseases most commonly associated with dementia - Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s - kill hundreds of thousands per year. Discovered a century ago, why haven’t we found a cure for these fatal conditions?
<br><br>
For this report, we will be primarily focusing on Alzheimer’s disease, the most fatal of the previously listed. First observed in 1906 by Alois Alzhiemer, he described it as a “peculiar severe disease process of the cerebral cortex. Current Alzheimer’s Disease research associates disease emergence with genetic, environmental, and age factors, but no specific causes have been found. The disease is characterized by the overproduction and tangling of Amyloid-Beta and Tau proteins, which block nutrient and nerve impulse flow to neurons, which quickly leads to cell death. MRIs of severe Alzheimer’s patients show a significant loss of brain matter.
<br><br>
There are many possible reasons neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s have no cure. Even though there are millions of medical professionals and hundreds of nonprofit organizations dedicated to the research of Alzheimer’s, that research has only gained traction in the last couple decades. The simplest reason is that we just don’t know what causes it. The brain is an exceptionally complex organ, and identifying a genetic/environmental cause is difficult with the level of technology that is currently available. Although we can detect neurofibrillary tangles through PET scans, their existence is a symptom, not a cause. Another explanation for the lack of research throughout the 1900s is disease pathogenesis. With most Alzheimer’s patients experiencing symptoms in their late 60s, it is possible that life expectancy at the time was not developed enough to observe late stage symptoms. In conclusion, the lack of information regarding Alzheimer’s origins and insignificance during its discovery led to a period of research stagnation.

<h2>Why Is The Coronavirus So Hard To Cure?</h2>
<p>By Kevin Bai - Sept 28th, 2020</p>
<img src = "Covid.jpg" width = 600 height = 420>
<p style="font-size: 16px">
The Covid-19 Pandemic is arguably the defining event of 2020. With over 1 million deaths worldwide of the total 35 million cases, the disease has put tremendous strain on countries’ health care systems. Amidst the chaos, numerous pharmaceutical companies have attempted to create a vaccine, but none have produced considerable results. This raises the question of why the Coronavirus - and other viral infections - are so hard to cure.
<br><br>
Covid-19 is classified as a coronavirus, a family of RNA viruses with distinct crown-like spikes on their surface (not named after the beer company). These spikes are glycoproteins that allow the virus to bind and infect host lung cells, which is why coronaviruses are mainly respiratory diseases. Your lung cells have a plethora of different receptor proteins outside their cell membrane, allowing vital molecules to enter. Coronaviruses exploit this function in order to sneak inside the cell, where they subsequently disintegrate and release their viral RNA. In fact, this RNA strand is the main reason viral infections are so hard to cure.
<br><br>
RNA replication is much more susceptible to mutation than regular DNA because of its comparatively unstable structure. However, the frequent breaking of RNA is actually a benefit to viruses, as every mutation changes their molecular structure enough to render antibodies and vaccines useless. Trying to keep up with these viral mutations is extremely difficult because of mutation speed and randomness, but scientists are making progress.
<br><br>
There are a plethora of trial vaccines being produced to combat Covid-19. The 2 most promising vaccines being developed are mRNA and rVSV vaccines. mRNA vaccines introduce a synthetic mRNA into your body in order to stimulate antibody production, which will produce antibodies to combat Covid-19 without the risk of being infected. The latter uses a modified vesicular stomatitis virus to deliver genuine Covid-19 RNA into cells (this method has proven useful in combating diseases such as Ebola).
<br><br>
However, each of these options have drawbacks. mRNA vaccines tend to require multiple doses to achieve a significant immune response, whereas rVSV vaccines may lead to an actual infection. No matter whichever vaccine is finalized first, we must remember that the vaccine will not make Covid-19 disappear. For the considerable future, we all need to follow state safety guidelines in order to protect those more vulnerable.

<h2>Dopamine’s role in preventing Parkinson’s Disease</h2>
<p>By Kevin Bai - Oct 16th, 2020</p>
<p  style="font-size: 16px">
Parkinson’s Disease, a form of dementia, is a neurological disorder characterized by stiffness, tremors, and difficulty walking/balancing. As the disease progresses, symptoms expand to include memory and talking difficulties, and patients will often experience these symptoms until death. Genetics has been identified as a cause of Parkinson’s, but other unknown environmental factors account for a majority of cases.
<br><br>
Research has identified an absence of cells within the substantia nigra of the brain which leads to malfunctions in dopamine synthesizing neurons, a major variable in the manifestation and progression of Parkinson’s. While the direct chemical relationship between lack of dopamine and Parkinson’s symptoms are not well understood, experimentation and studies show that Parkinson’s patients experience cell death in the limbic regions of the brain which lead to motor impairment. 
<br><br>
Although much of Parkinson’s disease remains unknown, we have developed medication that stabilize neurotransmitter concentration, mitigating the effect of Parkinson’s symptoms. Dopamine agonists (such as Mirapex or Requip) are a common prescription medication that have allowed Parkinson’s patients to live a relatively normal life. 
<br><br>
Dopamine agonists are artificial molecules that are structurally similar to dopamine, which allow them to activate the same receptors on nerve cells. The basal ganglia, an area of the brain that regulates movement, uses these agonists to reduce the influence of inhibitory neurotransmitters that make movements slow and laggy.
<br><br>
While the number of fatalities of Parkinson’s is less than other diseases such as Alzheimer’s, its importance to medical research is important nonetheless. Understanding dopamine and other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin will allow psychologists and neurologists to solve similarly dire problems such as addiction.

<h2>An Overview of Multiple Sclerosis: History, Pathogenesis, Treatment</h2>
<p>By Kevin Bai - Nov 10th, 2020</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px">
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) was first defined and documented in 1868 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. Charcot was able to skillfully differentiate MS from Parkinson’s disease, another neurological disorder, using three key symptoms: intention tremors (slow, rhythmic, uncontrollable shaking), nystagmus (uncontrollable eye movement), and scanning speech (aka staccato speech). Although contemporary research shows that these symptoms are not unique to MS, Charcot’s research laid the groundwork for more sophisticated studies into the neuropathogenesis of MS and its symptoms.
<br><br>
MS is a persistent disease that affects the myelin sheath of nerve cells. MS is caused by a variety of sources, from genetics, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders. While the exact pathogenesis of MS is unclear, lab testing shows that each factor contributes to cell death. In autoimmune forms of MS, the disease often attacks the body in phases, tricking the body’s immune system to attack cells within the central nervous system. While the body demonstrates some form of healing, scar tissue quickly begins to build up (shown as white regions on MRI scans), causing irreversible damage. In genetic MS, the disease causes a breakdown of myelin, a fatty gel-like substance that coats the axon of nerves. The myelin acts as an insulator, similar to the rubber coating of a wire, ensuring that electrical signals are not lost or interfered with. In patients with MS, functions of the brain such as movement and vision become impaired. These attacks typically occur in heavily myelinated regions of the brain, such as the brainstem and white matter areas (e.g the inner section of the brain).
<br><br>
Like many neurological disorders, MS has no absolute cure. However, its long history of observation and research have provided scientists time to gather crucial information about disease progression. Currently, anti-inflammatory medication is effective at slowing down MS, while cures such as Simvastatin (a type of neuroprotective medication that prevents further damage to nerve cells) are in phase 3 trials.

<h2>Nanoparticle Protection Aiding Anti-Cancer Drug Treatments
</h2>
<p>By Kevin Bai - Dec 31st, 2020</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px">
<h4>Overview of nanoparticles</h4><br><br>
The term nanotechnology and nanoscience was used long before any actual concepts had been developed. In a 1959 talk at CalTech, physicist Richard Feynman gave a lecture titled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.” In this talk, Feynman hypothesized that scientists would be able to control individual atoms and molecules in the future, and provided theories as to how such technology could be created. It would take another 22 years before the first ultraprecision machine, the scanning tunneling microscope (SEM), was developed. Capable of imaging individual atoms, it marked the advent of modern nanotechnology.
<br><br>
A nanoparticle is defined as a substance less than 100 nanometers wide (but can refer to anything up to 500 nm). Since the emergence of nanotechnology in the 1970s, engineers have used these microscopic particles to make a variety of products from scratch-proof glass, stain resistant fabrics, and ceramic solar cell coatings. While its ubiquity in consumer goods often goes overlooked, its unique applications in medicine will be the focus of this article.
<br><br>
Nanotechnology and nanoparticles have recently gained traction in the medical community for its unique properties. Because of nanoparticles’ miniscule size and large surface to volume ratio, they are able to pass through biological tissue and can be mixed to form composite materials with new properties. More recent innovations with nanoparticles include using them to aid in drug delivery systems, where they are known as nanocarriers, protecting medicine from degradation and guiding substances to correct target sites.
<br><br>
<h4>How are nanoparticles created?</h4><br><br>
The 2 most common methods to manufacture synthetic nanoparticles are the bottom-up and top-down approach. The top-down approach involves using special milling machines to pulverize larger structures into nanomaterials. The bottom-up method, which is much more sophisticated, involves using chemical reactions to produce molecules. The summaries of these methods are gross oversimplifications, as extensive preparation and series of reactions are planned in order to structure a desired nanoparticle.
<br><br>
It’s important to note that nanoparticles can be created/harvested in other unique ways, which is typically determined by the properties of the nanoparticle, as well as whether top-down or bottom-up is utilized. For example, a molecule of chitosan, which will be discussed more in-depth later, is broken down to a nanoparticle state when exposed to serum, a blood protein. 
<br><br>
<h4>Applications of nanoparticles</h4><br><br>
Nanoparticles are useful particularly in medicine because of their versatility. Artificial nanoparticles, as mentioned previously, can be engineered to have custom properties that make them useful for tasks such as ferrying drugs, and detection of diseases.
<br><br>
Let's take a look at target therapies, where nanoparticles can minimize the impact of treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which target large areas of the body. This is desirable, as treatments such as the two previously mentioned kill cancerous and normal cells on a large scale. With nanoparticles, we can increase the accuracy and efficacy of these treatment options, increasing the chance of survival and providing a tolerable experience for the patient.
<br><br>
A form of targeted therapy to treat breast cancer is the use of monoclonal antibodies, examples including the drugs Lapatinib and Bevacizumab. Laboratory manufactured proteins bind to cancer cells with an overabundance of a certain protein receptor, and block other molecules from attaching (competitive inhibition). Nullifying certain growth protein receptors on cancer cells aids in stifling cell multiplication and eliminates major side effects of other treatments, such as hair loss and nausea from radiation therapy.
<br><br>
Nanocarriers have much potential for drug delivery and targeted therapies. By coating medication with nanocarriers, scientists can create a shield that protects medicine from being broken down too early by our immune system, therefore increases the efficacy of medicine. In addition, scientists also attach especially engineered ligands to the nanoparticle. A ligand is a molecule that specifically binds to a target protein, and allows medicine to reach specific areas of the human body, mimicking the monoclonal antibodies in our example.
<br><br>
The purpose of a receptor protein on the cell membrane is to differentiate between necessary macromolecules. Synthetic ligands must have a protein to bind to, and the target must have different receptor proteins in order to prevent premature interaction by the nanocarrier. Because only a few small molecules can pass through the cell membrane passively, larger molecules must bind to a specific receptor protein before a vacuole is created to allow said molecule to enter the cell. After a nanoparticle ferrying a drug attaches to a receptor protein on the cell membrane, a vacuole will allow the drug to enter the cell membrane. This is one major barrier for scientists, as they must first find a unique protein before creating the ligand.
<br><br>
<h4>Current nanoparticle research </h4><br>
Heavy metals such as gold are commonly used in nanoparticles for their “ease of synthesis, chemical stability, and unique optical properties” (optical properties refer to biological imaging and detection). Currently, scientists are trying to gain a better understanding of gold’s toxicity and interaction with human cells. Although gold is claimed to be chemically inert and therefore “safe,” often used in anti inflammatory medication, studies show mixed results in laboratory testing, leading to a source of confusion and heavy debate.
<br><br>
Currently, there are several barriers and controversies stifling nanoparticle research. In addition to the toxicity debacle discussed earlier, injecting any amount of artificial molecules into a biological organism may have serious consequences. The ability for some chemicals to persist and accumulate in human bodies is a cause for concern. A recent study showed that carbon nanotubes seemed to produce toxic effects as a result of their shape, which introduces another possible danger in the development of these nanotechnologies.
<br><br>
This is why the recent innovations such as Dr.Zhang’s chitosan nanocarrier are significant breakthroughs. Current research hypothesizes that because the nanocarrier molecule is derived from an naturally occurring organic compound (chitin, found in shrimp), it has less toxicity than other artificial compounds. This new theory provides a lead for researchers to explore and produce a new series of naturally derived nanoparticles which may account for most if not all of the toxic effects associated with artificial ones.
<br><br>
<h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
The use of nanoparticles in anti-cancer drug treatments highlights the significance of interdisciplinary studies in the modern world. Research in cell biology, bioengineering, chemistry, and pharmacology all play a crucial role in the creation of these coated medicines. The coalescence of these various fields of research indicate the burgeoning of a new type of product development unafraid of breaking barriers and crossing boundaries. In the future, it may not be uncommon to see architects, nuclear scientists and chemists create superstructures with new artificial, highly durable materials on the atomic level. In any case, there’s plenty of room for optimism and hope.

<h2>An Overview of Covid-19 Vaccine Candidates
</h2>
<p>By Kevin Bai - Feb 17th, 2021</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px">
<h4>Introduction</h4><br><br>
This report serves to clarify and explain a previous article's reference of Coronavirus vaccines and explore the biological mechanisms behind the three vaccines that are currently in clinical trials: mRNA, protein subunit, and vector. This article will also provide additional information on the history, development, and advantages/disadvantages of each vaccine type in order to demonstrate their utility.
<br><br>
<h4>The Development/Approval Process of Vaccines
</h4><br><br>
The 2 most common methods to manufacture synthetic nanoparticles are the bottom-up and top-down approach. The top-down approach involves using special milling machines to pulverize larger structures into nanomaterials. The bottom-up method, which is much more sophisticated, involves using chemical reactions to produce molecules. The summaries of these methods are gross oversimplifications, as extensive preparation and series of reactions are planned in order to structure a desired nanoparticle.The first step in vaccine development is the exploratory stage, which involves the consolidation of ideas, research, and development to identify a method of treating a disease. This stage is funded by the government, with several companies racing to become the lead vaccine candidate.
<br><br>
The second stage are the preclinical trials, where prototype vaccines are tested to record safety and immunogenicity (how well the vaccine elicits an immune response). Scientists typically test the vaccines on monkeys and mice because of their genetic similarities to humans, obtaining important data such as dosage, side effects, and cellular responses. It is also this stage that most vaccine candidates drop out, as they are unable to produce a desired immune response.
<br><br>
Before the next stage, the vaccine developer - usually a private company - will submit an application for an Investigational New Drug to the FDA. An institutional review board will examine the vaccine’s associated reports, studies, testing and manufacturing processes before approval for the next stage.
<br><br>
The next stages involve using human subjects, broken up into three phases. For phase 1, the vaccine is tested on a small group (80-100 people) to assess its general safety. Researchers may also attempt to infect participants after vaccination, monitoring the conditions of the experimental group very closely in this “challenge model.” With favorable results, phase 2 testing will proceed. In this phase, the vaccine is tested on more vulnerable age groups such as the elderly. Random samples are increased to several hundreds of people, with safety, proposed doses, schedule of immunizations, and method of delivery being variables of interest. Phase 3 is the final phase of human trials, involving tens of thousands of people. In addition to vaccine efficacy, as tested in the previous trials, a unique phase 3 goal is to determine if there are rare side effects of the vaccine, hence the use of an extremely large sample group.
<br><br>
Assuming Phase 3 trials are successful, the vaccine developer will submit a Biological Licence Application to the FDA, leading into the approval/manufacturing stage. The FDA will inspect and monitor production of the vaccine, reviewing testing data for potency, safety, and efficacy. If necessary, the FDA is allowed to conduct its own testing of the manufactured vaccines. In order to hasten the vaccine distribution process, developers are often allowed to start mass production of vaccines during the licensing stage.
<br><br>
<h4>mRNA Vaccine</h4><br><br>
mRNA vaccines have been in development since 1990, where Hungarian-born scientist Katalin Kariko and her team struggled for decades to produce a vaccine built off mRNA transcription. The idea was simple. The body relies on millions of proteins to keep itself functioning and healthy, and these protein recipes are encoded in our DNA, which is locked away in the nucleus. RNA polymerase copies half of the DNA section to create a strand of mRNA. This “messenger RNA” finds and relays its information to the ribosome, which translates the nucleotide sequence into a chain of amino acids that make up a specific protein. Kariko hypothesized that by injecting a synthetic mRNA into our cells, we could hijack this RNA transcription process to create any protein, such as antibodies to fight against infection.
<br><br>
A major barrier to this research was finding a reliable method to get custom mRNA into the cell. Kariko found difficulty collecting grants because of skepticism that the mRNA would be destroyed by our bodies’ immune system before finding its way into a cell. A subsequent demotion relegated Kariko’s work to “scientific backwater” until the emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic.
<br><br>
Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech were able to innovate Kariko’s original idea, using a synthetic lipid nanocarrier to surround the mRNA, protecting it and acting as a key to bypass the phospholipid bilayer of our cells. As for the mRNA portion, Moderna chose to engineer the portion of Coronavirus RNA that produces the spike proteins on its surface. Cells will produce these harmless spike proteins after RNA transcription and provide the immune system with “target practice” in identifying and destroying Coronavirus.

<h4>Protein Subunit Vaccines </h4><br>
Protein Subunit Vaccines are the simplest of the vaccines. They involve directly injecting purified Coronavirus spike proteins into your body in order to trigger an immune response. To improve the efficacy of this vaccination method, an immune stimulant  (known as an adjuvant) will be integrated into the vaccine. Currently, investigations are being conducted to find the best protein antigens for the vaccine, as well as how likely additional booster vaccines will be necessary. Unlike mRNA vaccines, Protein subunit vaccines are already well-established technologies and are being used to prevent diseases such as Hepatitis B, meningitis, and bacteremia.
<br><br>
While basic, protein subunit vaccines are particularly useful as there are no live viral components, and are arguably the safest. Those with weakened immune systems or other vulnerable populations can be inoculated with this vaccine variant with little risk of compromising their health.
<br><br>
<h4>Vector Vaccines</h4><br>
Viral vector vaccines use another virus that has been modified in order to produce a specific immune response. One example of a viral vector vaccine is Merck’s rVSV vaccine that aims to use a recombinant (genetically manipulated) virus in order to produce an immune response. The chosen virus for this task is the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, AKA VSV. This disease commonly infects farm animals and produces flu-like symptoms in infected humans; however, the disease is rarely fatal, making it a prime candidate as a viral vector. By replacing the VSV RNA that encodes its own spike protein with Covid-19’s spike RNA, you create a VSV virus with Coronavirus spikes. This rVSV will infect your cells and multiply, creating an immune response that builds immunity to Coronavirus. Because viral vector vaccines are live viruses, the immune response is much more powerful, increasing vaccine efficacy. Unlike the other vaccine candidates, vector vaccines expect only one dosage to build immunity, but they are relatively complex and difficult to produce.
<br><br>
rVSV vaccines have been in development since 2003, when the Public Health Agency of Canada created prototypes. Since then, several animal trials have been, all of them funded by the Canadian and US governments. In 2018, an rVSV vaccine made to combat ebola was licensed and has since been used in the DR Congo outbreak from 2018-2020.

<h4>Live/Weakened Vaccines</h4><br><br>
Live attenuated and weakened vaccines are the most common forms of vaccines. They are produced by harvesting and reproducing a “wild” virus/bacterium in a laboratory, which can be injected into a host to inoculate them. 
<br><br>
Producing these vaccines begin with incubating the virus in a foreign host, such as an egg (this is why certain vaccines have an allergy warning). The viruses will begin to replicate and mutate through random chance, and those with increased infectivity towards the current host dominate the population. These viral strains continue to mutate to better adapt to infecting its new host until it loses its efficacy in the target host, humans. This process, known as “passage,” makes it easier for the host’s immune system to eliminate the antigen while still maintaining the vaccine’s efficacy, as the laboratory created viral cultures are similar to the “wild” variant.
<br><br>
While these vaccine types are proven to be extremely effective in building immunity, almost eradicating deadly diseases such as polio and measles, the process of developing these vaccines takes a long time. The fastest of these vaccines, mumps and measles, took around 4 years to develop. With the ongoing pandemic, these options are simply too slow to be viable.
